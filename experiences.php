                With Continued support of DRISTI it is possible to bring about a change in this part of society. Although I had been working for the same alone since past 10 yrs but having backup of whole 20-30 member like-minded team is what was missing.They help our village in every possible way and are present in the whenever we ask them.

                At first we were quite doubtful about their intentions. We thought all of this was just a project of college. But their continued presence, numerous helpful activities, video programs, career counselling sessions clouds of doubt parted in our mind. We realised they are here for our help, to develop our village.

                Being a part of BIT Mesra people have been working in this direction but on a very small scale or some times single handed. Being the Principal of  Kislaya Vidya Mandir, i have tried to infuse discipline, dream of better future among kids of villages, but DRISTI works at the root level of problem i.e. the villages, generating interest among villagers towards development, health, hygiene, women empowerment.

                I am pleased to see that few students of our college have joined hands to form team DRISTI which works for the benefit of rural India. The thought of helping the needful at this early stages of their lives gives me immense happiness.
