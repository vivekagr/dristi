                        Being students, although we want to see great changes around us, we are always left with very few resources with us. Dristi has been one such medium that has made me materialize my thoughts for the society. It has helped me return my bit to this land. It feels wonderful when I actually see smiling faces at deserted places and knowing its repercussions satisfies me even more.

                        I believe in the power of social and technological integration for the upliftment of rural India. I possess the capability to transform rural Jharkhand into a collection of model villages. I spread hope and happiness in the hearts of numerous rural poor. I am utilsing my progressive outlook to create an understanding for opportunities in the minds of the poeple I work with. At the culmination of each work drive, I ensure that the smile passes on from myself to the faces of rural children.  I work for the transformation of rural Jharkhand. I am a DRISTI'an!

                        Having been invited by a group of seniors, and on the insistence of a friend, I went for a meeting organised by DRISTI to lay down the very foundations of the group, and decide upon the course of action that DRISTI would aim to perform. Initially, all of us, whether a first year junior or a 4th year senior, kept his/her point across, and these points, after great analysis and scrutiny, were taken up and put into practice. We started going to Masu, a village around 2.5 kms away from BIT campus, and after conducting sessions related to topics of rural importance like sanitation, alcoholism and health education, we felt motivated to participate more actively and work for the cause with all our heart.
