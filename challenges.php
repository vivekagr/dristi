            <p>BIT MESRA will celebrate its 58th anniversary in 2013, but the villages of Masu and Panchauli, unaware and adapted to a primitive life, located within a radius of 5km are still half a century behind it. The scenario and conditions of these villages have remained unchanged since years; the villagers are still tackling basic problems like sanitation and water supply. There are lack of toilets and hand-pumps and health care centers.</p>

            <p>Team DRISTI’s toughest challenge during its initial days was to develop a zone of comfort between the villagers and the students. We worked hard for their support, to make them believe that we are here to stay and their upliftment is our motto. A slow and steady process it was, involving numerous interactive sessions both at day and the evening, our male and female members of DRISTI who devoted their time befriending the villagers and talking to them about their problems. It took some time but we had their trust at last.</p>

            <p>After the first hurdle, came another, which was to prevalence of ignorance amongst the rural population. Team DRISTI faced a tough challenge to first blow away that cloud of uncertainty and naiveté and then show them the road to a healthy surrounding, well- being and bright future. After 3 months of scheduled visits and hard work of DRIST members some winds of change can now be felt in both the villages.</p>

            <p>A tough task for DRISTI now is the protection of the current generation from the drug and alcohol abuse.  A large population of rural Jharkhand is under the bad influence of country-made alcohol (toddy) and weed which is cultivated in Jharkhand and hence is consumed illegally on a large scale by the villagers. Team DRISTI is targeting the children, who are the immediate victims and females of the villages to create awareness about the dangers involved in the consumption and the negative after-effects of the same. Also we are trying to seek professional help to tackle this issue.</p>

            <p>And of course there are day to day challenges faced by DRISTI members who are full time students and part time social workers. Working in the grueling heat, long walks under the Sun, crossing the fields, jungle and the river that separate BIT MESRA from the villages, putting personal security at risk as Jharkhand is vastly infected by Naxal groups which operate in the tribal belts.</p>

            <p>But as somebody has rightly said “Be the change you want to see”. So to bring about a change, each member of Team DRISTI has come out of their comfort zone, sacrificed their sleep, sweated in the Sun and lost some weight to be the change that they wanted to see.</p>
