                <p>Yes everything in this world has a very simple start and so is the case of DRISTI. A mere attempt to utilize my free time turned into an idea for social change. Here is how.</p>

            <p>It was freezing and I was on a trip to my paternal village- a small hamlet 50 miles away from Gorakhpur city. Pretty content with the New Year celebrations, my life seemed quite aimless post the bash, in the bitingly cold conditions, with my blanket being my only companion. Yes, I was house trapped.</p>
            <p>All I could feel apart from being frost bitten was nostalgia. The best chapter of my life was about to end, my college life. I wanted to get back as soon as I could. But the vacations wouldn't end because of an employee strike.</p>

            <p>The high-point of those boring days was mom made delicacies. What in the world could beat that! I was somehow killing time during daylight. But nights were worse. Without fail, there was a power-cut every night, till 11 p.m. which made it impossible to engage in any other activity other than sleeping. I capitulated, but not without a struggle. Tossing and turning in my bed, I harnessed my thoughts to come up with something which would keep me well-occupied in such adverse conditions. To somehow put every brain in the village to work, rather than wasting those precious hours by playing card and loitering in the vicinity. But what? How? That was what I thought about.</p>

            <p>Vacations ended, and so did my dream of 'moving mountains'. Back on campus I had forgotten all about it. It was only during mid-semesters, the time when everything and anything seems interesting, did the idea of channeling the villagers' time in doing something constructive popped back. And now my chain of thoughts had triggered. There were thoughts like pieces of puzzle; I had to somehow complete the map. So I thought of going forward with those pieces, letting things fall into place eventually. Like they say, “A drop in the ocean.”</p>

            <p>My first thought was, how less the people in villages knew of the world outside. Therefore I planned on bringing that world to them, the myriad of opportunities that they didn't know existed. But for implementing my ideas, I needed like-minded people, which didn't seem to be a problem at all. I was amazed by the response of people willing to be a part of this initiative. And soon team DRISTI started taking a shape and with time it’s getting better and better every passing day.</p>

            <p>We commenced by publicizing the idea during mid-semesters itself. It was only after the exams that we began with something substantial. Our feasible targets were villages those were in close vicinity of our college, B.I.T. Mesra. Accumulation of adequate resources, building a strong team, permissions from college authorities and the necessary support of the villagers and college authorities were the first few steps.</p>

            <p>The first session we did at a village called Masu, 4kms south of BIT was a huge success. We were overwhelmed by the crowd that turned up for the session in which we showed them a video on patriotism and did a survey to find out the problems faced by the villagers. Being sceptical about an inception is only natural, but as the number of surveys grew, ounce by ounce our belief and confidence in this did too.  It only seemed right to call it DRISTI (Directing Rural India Towards Social and Technological Integration).</p>

            <p>We are a group of more than 100 students, which comprises of 2009 students assisted by their dedicated and disciplined juniors. Since mass participation of students is expected in the coming semesters, DRISTI has been institutionalized and is included in students’ activity. Dr. Jeeoot Singh (Associate Professor, Mechanical Engineering Department) has been immensely supportive of our cause right from its inception and is appointed as our faculty advisor to guide our thoughts and actions towards our goals.</p>
