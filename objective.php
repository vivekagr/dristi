                <p>DRISTI stands for ‘Directing Rural India towards Social and Technological Integration’. It’s an initiative by students of BIT Mesra to aid in the development of rural India. We aspire to create awareness about health, sanitation, water conservation, education, addiction and many more socio-economic problems as well as to hold workshops about career counseling and skill development.</p>
                <p>The current project is targeting the students of STD 6th to 12th and graduation students.</p>
                <p>As of today, DRISTI has more than 100 members from various engineering disciplines and our major objectives are as follows:</p>
                <h2 class="heading-text heading-text-blue">Skill Development and General Awareness Programs</h2>
                <p>Providing them with a sound basic knowledge which includes introducing them to the everyday technology and improving their language skills, as no country has ever succeeded if it has not educated its people. Not only is education important in reducing poverty, it is also a key to wealth creation. It also focuses on imparting value and moral education. We aspire to achieve our goals by imparting basic compute, internet skills and also by holding spoken English and Hindi workshops.</p>
                <h2 class="heading-text heading-text-blue">Career Counseling Sessions</h2>
                <p>Focusing on issues such as career exploration, career change, personal career development and other career related issues based on the surveys conducted. This can be realized by performing the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Formulating and conducting surveys based on career interests of the target group.</li>
                    <li>Enlightening them about various upcoming employment fields in their areas.</li>
                    <li>Encouraging them towards better employment opportunities.</li>
                    <li>To bridge the gap between BIT and the villages in the vicinity so that they could be benefited by various study and employment opportunities that this institute offers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="heading-text heading-text-blue">Spreading awareness about Government schemes</h2>
                <p>Making the villagers aware about various Central, State specific or joint collaboration between the Center and the States government schemes. For example, various health and scholarship schemes. This incorporates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting to know all the government schemes that are there for rural upliftment.</li>
                    <li>Making the villagers aware of these schemes.</li>
                    <li>Contacting the concerned authorities if the above are not implemented properly.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="heading-text heading-text-blue">Addressing Women Related Issues</h2>
                <p>Despite many measures women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They usually have less access than men to medical care, property ownership, credit, training and employment. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence. Our target is to address these issues and empower these women so that they play a major role in the society and bring about a visible change. The following can be done in this direction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introducing De-Addiction schemes.</li>
                    <li>Promoting a sense of security and self-dependency through our interactive sessions.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="heading-text heading-text-blue">Self-improvement and Personal Development Programs</h2>
                <p>A customized personal development program might help in providing the members with practical tips, tools and proven strategies for developing powerful interpersonal skills which is required to build a peak-performance workplace. This can be done by providing them with internship opportunities at various organizations.</p>
